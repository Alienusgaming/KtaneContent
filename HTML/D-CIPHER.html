                <h2>On the Subject of D-CIPHER</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">THE MOTHERSHIP DEMANDS YOUR ATTENTION.</p>

                <p>The module presents you with eight alien glyphs, as well as two sets of smaller glyphs.</p>
				<p>The eight glyphs correspond to a word that has been encrypted with a Playfair cipher and a Caesar cipher, in that order.</p>
				<p>The first set of small glyphs is the key used by the Caesar cipher. The second set is the key used by the Playfair cipher.</p>
				<p>To solve the module, decrypt the word and submit the decryption using the large glyphs.</p>
				<p>Upon holding a glyph, it will cycle through the entire alphabet of glyphs. Releasing will lock in the current glyph displayed.</p>
                <p>Once all eight glyphs have been locked in, the module will submit the word formed by the glyphs.</P>
				<p>To decrypt a Caesar cipher, shift each letter in the ciphertext backwards in the alphabet by the key</p>
				<p>To decrypt a Playfair cipher, first build a 5x5 keysquare by preprending the alphabet with the key and deleting repeats of the same letter. (I and J are interchangable, and the module uses I for both while encrypting the word.)</p>
				<p>Then, for each pair of letters, of which there are four:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>If the letters are in the same row or column in the keysquare, move each letter up or left along the column or row.</li>
                    <li>If they are not, take the letters in the opposite corners of the rectangle formed by the pair.</li> 
                </ul>
                <p> Note that the second of a pair of letters that are the same is changed to an X during the encryption process.</p>
